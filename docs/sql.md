### What is the default sorting order when using the `ORDER BY` clause in SQL?

In SQL, the default sort order for the `ORDER BY` clause is:

> **Ascending (ASC)**

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary;
```

üìå Key Points:

- ASC (Ascending) is default: smallest to largest (A ‚Üí Z, 0 ‚Üí 9).
- DESC (Descending): largest to smallest (Z ‚Üí A, 9 ‚Üí 0).

### How can you delete all data from a SQL table **without dropping the table structure**?

---

### üß† Answer

To remove all rows but **keep the table structure**, you can use:

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
```

| Feature               | `DELETE`                  | `TRUNCATE`                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Logs per row          | Yes                       | No (minimal logging)                             |
| Speed                 | Slower                    | Faster                                           |
| WHERE clause          | ‚úÖ Supported               | ‚ùå Not supported                                  |
| Resets auto-increment | ‚ùå Optional                | ‚úÖ Usually resets to 1                            |
| Triggers              | ‚úÖ Invokes triggers        | ‚ùå Usually doesn't invoke                         |
| Rollback              | ‚úÖ Yes (if in transaction) | ‚úÖ Depends on DB (e.g., PostgreSQL yes, MySQL no) |

-- Remove all data, keep table
TRUNCATE TABLE employees;
-- or
DELETE FROM employees;

üõë Warning:

- TRUNCATE is not reversible in some databases (e.g., MySQL).
- DELETE is safer if you need rollback support.

| Goal                      | Recommended Statement                     |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Just remove data          | `TRUNCATE TABLE your_table;`              |
| Remove data + use filters | `DELETE FROM your_table WHERE condition;` |

## ‚ùì What Does a NULL Value Mean in Oracle?

### What is a `NULL` value in Oracle Database, and how does it behave?

In Oracle, a `NULL` represents:

> A **missing**, **unknown**, or **undefined** value in a column.

It is **not zero**, **not an empty string**, and **not false** ‚Äî it's simply **"no value"**.

---

### üìå Key Characteristics of `NULL` in Oracle

| Feature             | Behavior                                    |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Unknown value       | Represents absence of any known value       |
| Not equal to anything | Not even equal to another `NULL`           |
| Not selected by default in comparisons | Must use `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL` |

---

### üß™ Example

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id IS NULL;
```

‚úÖ This selects all employees with no department assigned.

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary = NULL;
-- ‚ùå Incorrect: Will return no rows!
```

‚úÖ Correct form:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary IS NULL;
```

---

### üîÅ NULL in Expressions

- Any arithmetic or string operation involving `NULL` results in `NULL`.

```sql
SELECT 100 + NULL FROM dual;
-- Result: NULL
```

---

### üîß Handling NULLs with Functions

| Function                      | Description                               |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `NVL(expr1, expr2)`           | Replaces `NULL` with `expr2`              |
| `COALESCE(expr1, expr2, ...)` | Returns first non-null expression         |
| `NULLIF(a, b)`                | Returns `NULL` if a = b, else returns `a` |

#### Example

```sql
SELECT NVL(commission_pct, 0) FROM employees;
-- If commission_pct is NULL, return 0 instead.
```

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

- `NULL` = **Unknown or missing value**
- Always use `IS NULL` or `IS NOT NULL` for comparison
- Use `NVL`, `COALESCE`, etc. to handle NULLs safely

### Which data type should be used to store **very large text values** in Oracle and other SQL databases?

---

### üß† Answer

To store **very large blocks of text** (e.g., documents, logs, HTML, JSON), you should use a **large object (LOB)** data type.

---

## üî∂ Oracle: `CLOB` (Character Large Object)

- Used for **large character-based text**.
- Can store **up to 4 GB** of character data.
- Supports **Unicode** (if using `NCLOB`).

```sql
CREATE TABLE documents (
  id NUMBER,
  content CLOB
);
```

| DBMS           | Large Text Type | Max Size            | Notes                       |
| -------------- | --------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Oracle**     | `CLOB`, `NCLOB` | Up to 4 GB          | Use `CLOB` for text         |
| **MySQL**      | `LONGTEXT`      | Up to 4 GB          | Best for very large strings |
| **PostgreSQL** | `TEXT`          | Virtually unlimited | Efficient and preferred     |
| **SQL Server** | `VARCHAR(MAX)`  | Up to 2 GB          | Replaces deprecated `TEXT`  |

- For documents or large logs, always use LOBs like CLOB or TEXT, not VARCHAR(n).

- Indexing large text fields often requires full-text search features

## üîó What is the Use of Bind Variables in SQL?

### ‚úÖ Improved Question

What are **bind variables** in SQL and what is their purpose?

---

### üß† Answer

**Bind variables** (also called **placeholders** or **bind parameters**) are used to **pass values into SQL statements at runtime** without hardcoding the actual values.

They help improve:

- **Performance**
- **Security**
- **Code reusability**

---

## üéØ Purpose of Bind Variables

| Feature          | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| üîÅ Reusability    | SQL statements can be reused with different inputs                         |
| üöÄ Performance    | Reduces parsing overhead by reusing execution plans                        |
| üîê Security       | Prevents SQL injection attacks by separating data from code                |

---

## üß™ Example in Oracle PL/SQL

```sql
DECLARE
  emp_id NUMBER := 101;
BEGIN
  SELECT first_name INTO :name FROM employees WHERE employee_id = :emp_id;
END;

```

| Benefit     | Why It Matters                       |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Performance | Caches the execution plan in memory  |
| Security    | Eliminates SQL injection risks       |
| Flexibility | Easier to write modular, dynamic SQL |

üîß Bind vs Literal Example
‚ùå Without Bind Variable (Hardcoded):

```sql

SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = 10;
```

Compiled as a new query every time.

‚úÖ With Bind Variable:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department_id = :dept_id;
```

Compiled once, reused with different values ‚Äî faster & safer.

## üß† What is PL/SQL?

### ‚úÖ Improved Question:
What is PL/SQL, and what is it used for in Oracle databases?

---

### üìò Answer:

**PL/SQL** stands for **Procedural Language extensions to SQL**. It is **Oracle's procedural extension** for SQL that allows developers to **write code with variables, loops, conditions, and control structures** inside the database.

---

## üß© Key Features of PL/SQL

| Feature          | Description                                                       |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| üìú Block structure | Code is written in logical blocks: `DECLARE`, `BEGIN`, `EXCEPTION`, `END` |
| üîÅ Control flow    | Supports `IF`, `LOOP`, `WHILE`, `FOR`, etc.                      |
| üõ†Ô∏è Procedural logic | Enables writing procedures, functions, triggers, packages      |
| üîê Security        | Code can be stored and executed securely inside the database     |
| ‚ö° Performance     | Reduces network traffic and improves speed for complex logic     |

---

## üîß PL/SQL Block Structure

```sql
DECLARE
  -- Variable declarations
  message VARCHAR2(50);
BEGIN
  -- Executable statements
  message := 'Hello, PL/SQL!';
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(message);
EXCEPTION
  -- Error handling
  WHEN OTHERS THEN
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('An error occurred.');
END;
````

---

## üìÇ Types of PL/SQL Code Units

| Type            | Purpose                                 | Example Command    |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Anonymous Block | Ad hoc logic not stored in DB           | `BEGIN ... END;`   |
| Procedure       | Reusable logic with optional parameters | `CREATE PROCEDURE` |
| Function        | Returns a value                         | `CREATE FUNCTION`  |
| Package         | Groups procedures/functions             | `CREATE PACKAGE`   |
| Trigger         | Executes in response to DB events       | `CREATE TRIGGER`   |

---

## üß™ Simple Stored Procedure Example

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE greet_user(name IN VARCHAR2) IS
BEGIN
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Hello, ' || name || '!');
END;
```

Call it like:

```sql
BEGIN
  greet_user('Alice');
END;
```

---

## üìå Advantages of PL/SQL

- ‚úÖ Combines SQL + procedural features

Here's the improved version of your question ‚Äî **"What is a named PL/SQL block?"** ‚Äî along with a detailed answer in `.md` (Markdown) format:

---

```markdown
## üè∑Ô∏è What is a Named PL/SQL Block?

### ‚úÖ Improved Question:
What is a **named PL/SQL block**, and how is it different from an anonymous block?

---

### üß† Answer:

A **named PL/SQL block** is a **stored, reusable block of PL/SQL code** that is saved in the Oracle database with a specific name.

Unlike an **anonymous block**, a named block can be:

- Reused multiple times
- Called by name
- Granted privileges to other users
- Stored permanently in the database

---

## üß© Types of Named PL/SQL Blocks

| Type         | Description                          | Example Name       |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------|
| **Procedure**| Performs an action, doesn't return value | `calculate_salary` |
| **Function** | Returns a single value               | `get_total_salary` |
| **Package**  | Groups related procedures/functions   | `hr_package`       |
| **Trigger**  | Automatically runs on DB events       | `audit_trigger`    |

---

## üìò Example: Named Procedure

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE greet_user(name IN VARCHAR2) IS
BEGIN
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Hello, ' || name || '!');
END;
```

- This creates a **named block** called `greet_user`
- Stored in the DB and callable any time

---

## üì• Calling the Named Procedure

```sql
BEGIN
  greet_user('Alice');
END;
```

---

## ‚ùì How is it Different from an Anonymous Block?

| Feature               | **Anonymous Block**        | **Named Block**              |
|------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Name                  | No                         | Yes (has identifier)          |
| Storage in DB         | Not stored                 | Stored in data dictionary     |
| Reusability           | One-time use               | Can be reused/called anytime  |
| Privilege Management  | Not possible               | Can grant execution rights    |

---

## üîê Security & Access Control

- Named blocks can have **permissions** (e.g., `GRANT EXECUTE ON procedure_name TO user`)
- Useful in **multi-user environments**

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

- **Named PL/SQL blocks** are **stored code objects** with names.
- Includes **procedures**, **functions**, **packages**, and **triggers**.
- They are reusable, secure, and modular ‚Äî ideal for large, enterprise applications.

````markdown
## üéØ What is a Cursor in PL/SQL?

### ‚úÖ Improved Question:
What is a **cursor** in PL/SQL, and why is it used?

---

### üß† Answer:

In **PL/SQL**, a **cursor** is a **pointer to the context area** on the server where query results are stored. Cursors allow you to **process query result rows one at a time**.

They are primarily used when a **query returns multiple rows**, and you want to **iterate through them** programmatically.

---

## üß© Types of Cursors in PL/SQL

| Cursor Type     | Description                                      |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Implicit Cursor** | Automatically created by Oracle for single-row queries (`SELECT INTO`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) |
| **Explicit Cursor** | Defined by the programmer to handle multi-row queries |

---

## üìò Example: Explicit Cursor

```sql
DECLARE
  CURSOR emp_cursor IS
    SELECT first_name, salary FROM employees WHERE department_id = 10;

  v_name   employees.first_name%TYPE;
  v_salary employees.salary%TYPE;
BEGIN
  OPEN emp_cursor;
  LOOP
    FETCH emp_cursor INTO v_name, v_salary;
    EXIT WHEN emp_cursor%NOTFOUND;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(v_name || ' earns ' || v_salary);
  END LOOP;
  CLOSE emp_cursor;
END;
````

---

## üîç Cursor Attributes

| Attribute   | Description                                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `%FOUND`    | Returns `TRUE` if last fetch returned a row |
| `%NOTFOUND` | Returns `TRUE` if last fetch failed         |
| `%ROWCOUNT` | Returns number of rows fetched so far       |
| `%ISOPEN`   | Checks if cursor is currently open          |

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Cursor FOR Loop (Simplified Syntax)

```sql
BEGIN
  FOR rec IN (SELECT first_name, salary FROM employees WHERE department_id = 10) LOOP
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(rec.first_name || ' earns ' || rec.salary);
  END LOOP;
END;
```

‚úÖ No need to explicitly `OPEN`, `FETCH`, or `CLOSE` the cursor ‚Äî it‚Äôs all handled automatically.

---

## ‚úÖ When to Use a Cursor?

- When you need to **process rows one-by-one**
- When your logic depends on **per-row operations**
- For **complex looping** with control over each fetch

---

## üö´ When Not to Use

- When you're processing **bulk data**, prefer **bulk collect** or **set-based operations** for performance

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

- A **cursor** allows row-by-row processing of query results.
- **Explicit cursors** are manually declared and controlled.
- Useful for **complex looping** and row-level logic in PL/SQL.

---

Would you like a `.md` comparison between cursors vs. bulk collect, or examples of cursor usage in real business cases?

Great! Based on your follow-up **"all N"**, it seems you're asking for an explanation of all **database normalization forms (1NF to 5NF, and beyond)** ‚Äî these are often referred to as **NFs** in relational database design.

Here's a complete `.md` (Markdown) formatted explanation of **all Normal Forms (NFs)**:

---

```markdown
# üß† Database Normalization: All Normal Forms (1NF to 5NF + BCNF)

## üìò What is Normalization?
Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce **data redundancy** and improve **data integrity**.

It breaks down tables to ensure that:
- Each table has a **single purpose**
- Relationships are clearly defined
- Data is stored efficiently and safely

---

## ‚úÖ 1NF ‚Äì First Normal Form

### üéØ Rule:
- Eliminate repeating groups
- Ensure atomic (indivisible) values in each cell

### ‚úÖ Conditions:
- Each column contains only **single, atomic values**
- Each row is unique (use a primary key)

### ‚ùå Violates 1NF:
| ID | Name  | Phone Numbers        |
|----|-------|----------------------|
| 1  | Alice | 12345, 67890         |

### ‚úÖ In 1NF:
| ID | Name  | Phone Number |
|----|-------|--------------|
| 1  | Alice | 12345        |
| 1  | Alice | 67890        |

---

## ‚úÖ 2NF ‚Äì Second Normal Form

### üéØ Rule:
- Must be in 1NF
- Remove **partial dependencies** (non-key attribute depends on only part of a composite key)

### ‚úÖ Fix:
Move partially dependent columns to another table.

---

## ‚úÖ 3NF ‚Äì Third Normal Form

### üéØ Rule:
- Must be in 2NF
- Remove **transitive dependencies** (non-key depends on another non-key)

### ‚ùå Example:
| EmpID | EmpName | DeptID | DeptName |
|-------|---------|--------|----------|

- `DeptName` depends on `DeptID`, not `EmpID`

### ‚úÖ Fix:
Split into two tables:
- Employees: `EmpID, EmpName, DeptID`
- Departments: `DeptID, DeptName`

---

## ‚úÖ BCNF ‚Äì Boyce-Codd Normal Form

### üéØ Rule:
- Stronger version of 3NF
- For every functional dependency `A ‚Üí B`, A must be a **super key**

> Used when 3NF is technically satisfied but there are anomalies due to composite keys.

---

## ‚úÖ 4NF ‚Äì Fourth Normal Form

### üéØ Rule:
- Must be in BCNF
- Remove **multi-valued dependencies**

> A row should not contain two or more independent multi-valued facts about an entity.

---

## ‚úÖ 5NF ‚Äì Fifth Normal Form (Projection-Join Normal Form)

### üéØ Rule:
- Must be in 4NF
- Eliminate **join dependencies** that are not implied by candidate keys

> Rarely needed, used when reconstructing information from decomposed tables causes issues.

---

## ‚úÖ 6NF ‚Äì Sixth Normal Form (Theoretical)

- Breaks every table down to the **finest granularity**.
- Useful in **temporal databases** and data warehousing.
- Rare in real-world applications.

---

## üìä Summary Table

| Normal Form | Key Requirement                                 |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| 1NF         | Atomic values, unique rows                       |
| 2NF         | No partial dependencies                          |
| 3NF         | No transitive dependencies                       |
| BCNF        | Every determinant is a super key                 |
| 4NF         | No multi-valued dependencies                     |
| 5NF         | No join dependencies                             |
| 6NF         | Every non-trivial join dependency is implied     |

---

## ‚úÖ Why Normalize?

| Benefit              | Description                          |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| üßπ Reduces Redundancy | Avoids repeated data                 |
| üéØ Improves Integrity | Ensures consistency and reliability  |
| ‚ö° Increases Efficiency | Smaller, faster tables               |

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è When to Denormalize?

In performance-critical applications like analytics, denormalization may be used to:
- Reduce JOINs
- Improve read speed

But it increases data duplication.

# üß† Normalization Example (1NF to 5NF)

We'll use a **Student-Course-Teacher** example to explain each normalization form step-by-step.

---

## üî¥ Unnormalized Table (UNF)

| StudentID | StudentName | Courses         | Teachers        |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 1         | Alice       | Math, Physics   | Smith, Johnson  |
| 2         | Bob         | Chemistry       | Adams           |

- ‚ùå Multiple values in single columns
- ‚ùå Not atomic

---

## ‚úÖ 1NF ‚Äì First Normal Form

**Goal:** Eliminate repeating groups and ensure atomic values.

| StudentID | StudentName | Course     | Teacher   |
|-----------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| 1         | Alice       | Math       | Smith     |
| 1         | Alice       | Physics    | Johnson   |
| 2         | Bob         | Chemistry  | Adams     |

‚úÖ All values are atomic  
‚úÖ Still redundant (StudentName repeated)

---

## ‚úÖ 2NF ‚Äì Second Normal Form

**Goal:** Remove partial dependencies.

Here, `StudentID + Course` is the composite key.  
But `StudentName` depends only on `StudentID`, not the full key.

### Split Tables:

**Students Table:**
| StudentID | StudentName |
|-----------|-------------|
| 1         | Alice       |
| 2         | Bob         |

**Enrollments Table:**
| StudentID | Course     | Teacher   |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| 1         | Math       | Smith     |
| 1         | Physics    | Johnson   |
| 2         | Chemistry  | Adams     |

‚úÖ Partial dependency removed.

---

## ‚úÖ 3NF ‚Äì Third Normal Form

**Goal:** Remove transitive dependencies.

Assume:
- Each `Course` is taught by **one Teacher only**.

Then `Teacher` depends on `Course`, not `StudentID`.

### Split Again:

**Courses Table:**
| Course     | Teacher   |

‚úÖ Transitive dependency removed.

---

## ‚úÖ BCNF ‚Äì Boyce-Codd Normal Form

**Goal:** Every determinant is a candidate key.

If a Course can be taught by **multiple teachers in different semesters**, then:

```text
Course, Semester ‚Üí Teacher
````

Now, `Course ‚Üí Teacher` is **not valid** anymore.

So split further if needed.

---

## ‚úÖ 4NF ‚Äì Fourth Normal Form

**Goal:** Remove multi-valued dependencies.

Assume:

- A student can have **multiple hobbies**
- A student can enroll in **multiple courses**

### Violating 4NF

| StudentID | Hobby    | Course  |
| --------- | -------- | ------- |
| 1         | Music    | Math    |
| 1         | Painting | Math    |
| 1         | Music    | Physics |
| 1         | Painting | Physics |

- Hobby and Course are **independent** multi-valued facts.

### Split to

**StudentHobbies**

| StudentID | Hobby    |
| --------- | -------- |
| 1         | Music    |
| 1         | Painting |

**Enrollments**

| StudentID | Course  |
| --------- | ------- |
| 1         | Math    |
| 1         | Physics |

‚úÖ 4NF achieved.

---

## ‚úÖ 5NF ‚Äì Fifth Normal Form

**Goal:** Remove join dependencies that can't be derived from candidate keys.

A very rare case.

Imagine:

> A student may take a course, in a department, from a specific professor.

All combinations must be stored.

To eliminate redundancy, you'd break into:

- Student-Course table
- Student-Professor table
- Course-Professor table

And use JOINs to reconstruct.

## ‚úÖ Summary Table

| Normal Form | Fixes                                   |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 1NF         | Atomic columns, no multi-values         |
| 2NF         | No partial dependency on composite keys |
| 3NF         | No transitive dependency                |

## üßæ What is the Full Form of BASE in Database Systems?

### ‚úÖ Improved Question

What does **BASE** stand for in the context of **NoSQL databases**, and how is it different from ACID?

---

### üß† Answer

**BASE** is an acronym used in **NoSQL databases** to describe their approach to **data consistency** ‚Äî it stands for:

> **B**asically **A**vailable, **S**oft state, **E**ventual consistency

---

## üîç Breakdown of BASE

| Term               | Meaning                                                                 |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Basically Available** | System guarantees availability ‚Äî even in the face of partial failures |
| **Soft State**          | The state of the system may change over time (even without input)    |
| **Eventual Consistency**| System will become consistent **eventually**, not immediately       |

# üß™ What is ACID in Database Systems?

### ‚úÖ Improved Question:
What does **ACID** stand for in relational databases, and why is it important?

---

## üî§ Full Form of ACID

> **A**tomicity, **C**onsistency, **I**solation, **D**urability

ACID properties ensure **reliable, predictable, and safe transactions** in relational databases like Oracle, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.

---

## üìò Breakdown of ACID Properties

| Property     | Description                                                                 |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Atomicity**   | All operations in a transaction succeed or none do. No partial updates.   |
| **Consistency** | Transaction brings the database from one valid state to another.          |
| **Isolation**   | Transactions run independently without interfering with each other.       |
| **Durability**  | Once a transaction is committed, the data is saved permanently‚Äîeven if the system crashes. |

---

## üß™ Example Scenario

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 500 WHERE id = 2;
COMMIT;
````

If any step fails:

- **Atomicity** rolls back the entire transaction.
- **Consistency** ensures total amount stays the same.
- **Isolation** prevents other transactions from seeing half-completed changes.
- **Durability** ensures committed changes survive power loss or crash.

---

## üîÑ ACID vs BASE (Comparison)

| Feature      | **ACID (Relational DBs)**           | **BASE (NoSQL DBs)**                 |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Model Focus  | Data integrity & strict consistency | High availability & scalability      |
| Consistency  | Immediate and strong                | Eventual                             |
| Isolation    | Strict transaction separation       | Often relaxed or application-managed |
| Durability   | Guaranteed                          | Often configurable                   |
| Availability | May be compromised during failures  | Always available                     |
| Examples     | Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL           | MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB         |

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

- **ACID** ensures safe and correct database transactions.
- Ideal for **banking**, **finance**, and **critical systems**.
- Guarantees **reliability, consistency, and fault tolerance**.

---

## üîç Acronym Recap

| Letter | Meaning     | Ensures...                                      |
| ------ | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| A      | Atomicity   | All-or-nothing execution                        |
| C      | Consistency | Rules and constraints are never broken          |
| I      | Isolation   | Transactions don‚Äôt interfere                    |

Got it! Here's a clear **text list of the drawbacks of the Waterfall Model**, ideal for notes, exams, or documentation:

---

## üö´ Drawbacks of the Waterfall Model

1. **Rigid and Inflexible**

   - Once a phase is completed, it‚Äôs difficult to go back.
   - Not suited for projects where requirements may change frequently.

2. **Late Testing**

   - Testing happens only after the development is complete.
   - Bugs found late are more expensive to fix.

3. **No Working Product Until the End**

   - The client does not see any working software until the final stage.
   - Increases risk of misalignment with expectations.

4. **Poor Adaptability**

   - Difficult to adapt to feedback or evolving user needs mid-project.

5. **Limited User Involvement**

   - Clients are involved mainly in the requirements phase.
   - Lack of ongoing feedback can lead to incorrect outcomes.

6. **Risk of Project Failure**

   - If any one phase fails, the entire project can collapse.
   - No clear way to recover from major mistakes made early.

7. **Assumes Perfect Requirements**

   - Requires well-defined and stable requirements from the start.
   - Rare in real-world scenarios, especially for complex systems.

---

### ‚úÖ Best Used When

- Requirements are well-understood and unlikely to change.
- Project scope is fixed and well-documented.
- Technology is well-known and simple.

# üöÄ Agile Manifesto & Core Values

## üìú What is the Agile Manifesto?

The **Agile Manifesto** is a declaration of **principles and values** created by software developers in 2001 to improve software development practices.

It emphasizes:
- Flexibility
- Collaboration
- Customer satisfaction
- Iterative progress

---

## üí° The 4 Core Values of Agile

| Agile Prefers...                       | Over...                                       |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| ‚úÖ Individuals and interactions         | ‚ùå Processes and tools                         |
| ‚úÖ Working software                     | ‚ùå Comprehensive documentation                 |
| ‚úÖ Customer collaboration               | ‚ùå Contract negotiation                        |
| ‚úÖ Responding to change                | ‚ùå Following a rigid plan                      |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** The right-hand items are still important ‚Äî but Agile gives **more value** to the left-hand side.

---

## üîç Explanation of Each Value

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Individuals and Interactions over Processes and Tools
- Human collaboration leads to better outcomes than strict reliance on tools.
- Example: Quick team discussion > long email chains or rigid workflow tools.

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Working Software over Comprehensive Documentation
- A prototype or working app is more valuable than long documents.
- Agile favors delivering functionality early and often.

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Customer Collaboration over Contract Negotiation
- Agile involves customers **continuously**, not just at the start or end.
- Feedback loops keep the product aligned with real needs.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Responding to Change over Following a Plan
- Agile embraces change, even late in development.
- Plans are flexible and adaptive to new insights or market shifts.

---

## üìò Agile Principles (Bonus)

The Agile Manifesto is backed by **12 Principles**, including:
- Deliver working software frequently
- Welcome changing requirements
- Build projects around motivated individuals
- Sustainable development
- Simplicity is essential

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

The Agile Manifesto promotes:
- **People over process**
- **Flexibility over rigidity**
- **Working software over paperwork**
- **Customer collaboration over contracts**

Agile is not just a methodology ‚Äî it's a **mindset** focused on **iterative development and value delivery**.

## üéØ Example

Let‚Äôs say you're building a To-Do List App:

**Sprint Duration**: 2 weeks
**Sprint Goal**: Add core task management features
**Sprint Backlog**:

- [x] Create Task
- [x] Delete Task
- [ ] Edit Task
- [ ] Add Due Date

At the end, the team demos what's completed, gathers feedback, and improves in the next Sprint.

## üîÅ Sprint vs Iteration

| Term      | Used In            | Description                          |
| --------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Sprint    | Scrum (Agile)      | Time-boxed, with reviews and goals   |
| Iteration | XP / Generic Agile | Generic term for a development cycle |

---

## ‚ùó Important Notes

- Scope should **not change** once a sprint starts.
- Work should be **potentially shippable** by sprint end.
- Sprints allow **continuous delivery** and **early feedback**.
